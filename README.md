# SerDes Modeling for a Receiver Using MATLAB

This repository contains the design and modeling of a **Receiver** for a Serializer/Deserializer (SerDes) system using MATLAB. This project is part of our graduation project at **Cairo University, Faculty of Engineering, Electronics and Electrical Communications Department**.

---

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to model and design the **Receiver** side of a SerDes system. The receiver is composed of several key blocks that work together to recover the transmitted data accurately. The design focuses on simulating the behavior of these blocks and ensuring proper signal recovery in the presence of channel impairments.

## Key Components (Blocks)
The receiver design consists of the following blocks:
1. **Channel**: Models the transmission medium and its impairments (e.g., attenuation, noise, and distortion).
2. **CTLE (Continuous Time Linear Equalizer)**: Compensates for high-frequency losses in the channel.
3. **FFE (Feed-Forward Equalizer)**: Mitigates inter-symbol interference (ISI) by pre-processing the received signal.
4. **DFE (Decision Feedback Equalizer)**: Further reduces ISI by using past decisions to cancel out interference.
5. **LMS (Least Mean Squares)**: Adaptive algorithm used to optimize the equalizer coefficients.
6. **CDR (Clock and Data Recovery)**: Recovers the clock signal and retimes the data.
7. **FEC (Forward Error Correction)**: Detects and corrects errors in the received data using the **Reed-Solomon** algorithm.
